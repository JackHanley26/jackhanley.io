// when adding text in here make sure the div is tagged with the 'text-format' class so \n \t etc. works

export const main = {
  title: "Jack Hanley â€¢ Software Engineer",
  footer: "Designed and built by"
};

export const home = {
  greeting: "Hi, my name is",
  name: "Jack Hanley",
  title: "I build things with code.",
  summary: "I'm a software engineer from Ireland based in New York, NY",
};
